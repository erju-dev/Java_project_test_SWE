curiosidades.title=Fun facts about the districts of Madrid
curiosidades.descripcion=If you are passionate about curiosities and data, this is your section! Here you can find statistical data on the districts of the municipality of Madrid. Would you like to take a look?

curiosidades.tab1=Surface
curiosidades.superficietext=Looking at this graph showing the hectares (Ha) of the 21 districts of the municipality, one of them, Fuencarral - El Pardo, is striking. This green district is by far the largest, represents the northern end of the city. But this does not indicate that it is the most densely populated, since the percentage of urbanized areas represents less than 50% of the district, this is because it is within the same the Monte de El Pardo (it accounts for more than a quarter of the municipality of Madrid) and there are also many large companies. The most remote districts of the center are those that have more extension, can also be highlighted Villa de Vallecas, Moncloa-Aravaca and Barajas.

curiosidades.tab2=Density
curiosidades.densidadtext=This indicator is relevant as it indicates the living conditions in a particular district. A more densely populated district often has a lower quality of life in the absence of adequate urban and social planning. As can be seen, the district with the lowest density is Barajas, this is because it is a little residential district occupied mainly by the airport facilities and its surroundings. Followed by Villa de Vallecas, which is a remote district of the center of Madrid and little urbanized. The district with the highest density is Chamber\u00ed, followed by Tetu\u00e1n. This is because they are more central districts, and usually the central areas of cities tend to be the most populated due to urbanization processes and the growth of cities. Cities develop around their economic centres and when they become saturated, they begin to expand into peripheral areas as the population grows and requires more space and resources.

curiosidades.tab3=Gender distribution
curiosidades.sexostext=As can be seen in the graph above, in all districts the predominant gender is female, with the exception of the Centro district, which is the only one in Madrid where the majority of the inhabitants are men by little difference. We can also observe that the most populated districts are Carabanchel, Ciudad Lineal, Fuencarral-El pardo, Latina and Puente de Vallecas. These 5 districts comprise 37% of the total population of Madrid.

curiosidades.tab4=LGTBI support
curiosidades.lgtbitext=As can be seen in the chart below, Madrid is a city with a high inclusion rate for the LGTBI community. Overall, most districts have an LGTBI community friendliness index above 75%. The two districts that stand out for having the least kindness are, first Puente de Vallecas, followed by Villaverde. On the other hand, Ciudad Lineal is the district with the highest rate of kindness to the LGTBI community with 87%.

curiosidades.tab5=Electoral results
curiosidades.politicatext=As we can see in the graph above, the two parties most voted at the general level are the PSOE and the PP, and the party with the least votes in all districts is PACMA. On the other hand, we can observe that the neighborhoods with the greatest affinity to the PP are Salamanca, Chamart\u00edn and Retiro. On the contrary, the PSOE has more support in Puente de Vallecas, Villa de Vallecas and Usera. Particularly in the Centro district the Vox tiene party has less participation than in the other districts and the MAS PA\u00cdS party has more participation than in the other districts, in which VOX has more participation than MAS PA\u00cdS.
